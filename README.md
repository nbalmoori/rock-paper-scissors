Once the game is played and a winner is determined, the user has the option to keep playing at the same level of difficulty, or click a button to switch versions. The score will continue to be displayed even if the level of difficulty is changed. If a user would like to reset the game, they can click on the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" header.
