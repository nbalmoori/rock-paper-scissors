#Rock - Paper - Scissors

#Overview
Are you in a nostalgic mood to play a childhood game, but don't have anyone to play with? This application allows users to play an easy or difficult version of the classic game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" against a computer opponent.

This application was created by Nikki Balmoori in her sixth week of attending Turing School of Software & Design for her Mod 1 final solo project. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo.html).

#How To Use Rock-Paper-Scissors
Once the application is accessed, users have the option to pick from either a classic version of rock-paper-scissors or a difficult version of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-alien.

After a version is chosen, the player can start the game by clicking on the image they want to play.

Once the game is played and a winner is determined, the user has the option to keep playing at the same level of difficulty, or click a button to switch versions. The score will continue to be displayed even if the level of difficulty is changed. If a user would like to reset the game, they can click on the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" header.
